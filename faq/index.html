        <b>I ran the run.bat file and it instantly closes, what do i do?</b>

        <br><br>
        <b>Does Fleasion work with Bloxstrap?</b>
        <br>
        > Yes. The feature "default skyboxes" even helps Bloxstrap with custom skyboxes.
        <br>
        > If using said feature responds with Bloxstrap not being present,
        <br>
        > you either have it in a custom directory or don't have it at all.
        <br><br>
        <b>Is it possible to make texture packs?</b>
        <br>
        > Not as simple as it sounds. You will get artifacts and things will not render at range.
        <br><br>
        <b>Why are my sleeves sometimes red and sometimes blue?</b>
        <br>
        > Phantom Forces applies a tint depending on which team you're playing as.
        <br>
        > This is something you have to deal with.
        <br><br>
        <b>Can we add <i>something that doesn't exist in the game yet?</i></b>
        <br>
        > No. Fleasion can only replace or remove, not create.
        <br><br>
        <b>Can we have a hash for `____`?</b>
        <br>
        > Yes. Just ask someone from the Fleasion Team or make a Question post in the forum channel in <a href="https://discord.gg/spezi" class="underscore hyperlink">Spezi's Discord server</a>.
        <br>
        > Important, there will be situations where that isn't remotely possible.
        <br><br>
        <b>Can we get this sound/texture/etc.?</b>
        <br>
        > Yes. Make a post in this forum channel with Sound Request, Texture Request or Other tags.
        <br><br>
        <b>Can we manually edit presets?</b>
        <br>
        > Yes. The presets.json file already comes with 1 preset, so just comply with json formatting and you're good.
